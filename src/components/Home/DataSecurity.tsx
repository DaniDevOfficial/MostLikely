                When using the app, certain basic information such as your username, game preferences, and game activity may be collected. However, the app makes every effort to minimize data collection and only collects what is necessary for the game's functionality.

            <Text mt={2}>
                It's important to note that the app does not store any personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what is necessary for the game experience. Please do not share sensitive information during gameplay ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±.
